# ISIA-apparatus
The 'Immersive social interactions assay' (ISIA) apparatus consists of chambers connected by a perforated plastic tube. To confine a mouse to one of the chambers, a plastic ring can be inserted into the tube, reducing its diameter. This modification ensures that mice with head-bars cannot move between the chambers, while mice without head-bars can move freely between them.

Perforated plastic tube dimensions: Length: 13.5 mm; Inner diameter: 3.7 mm.
Plastic ring dimensions: Inner diameter: 2.5 cm; Length: 1.5 cm.

You can find the 3D design files for the tube and ring, as well as images of the two-chamber apparatus.
